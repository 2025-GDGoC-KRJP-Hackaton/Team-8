Can we finalize the landing page design by next Thursday? I think we’ll need it for the demo.

I can take care of that. We’ll probably use Tailwind and Next.js, right?

Reminder to integrate the Gemini API into the chatbot before Monday. We want to go commandless asap.

Also someone please create a Notion board to track these tasks 🙏

I'll handle Notion setup today.

Don't forget to test the webhook integration with Vercel deployments — it's a bit buggy.

Oh, and we should migrate the SQLite storage to Firebase before the end of the week.
