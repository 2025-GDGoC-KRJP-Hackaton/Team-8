## 🗨️ How to Talk to the Bot

- Use `/ticket` to let Tickr scan past messages and generate a list of tasks with due dates and descriptions.
- Team members can react to a ticket with an emoji to be automatically assigned to it.
- If a ticket includes a due date, Tickr will generate a Google Calendar invite link.
- Right-click a ticket to mark it as complete and remove it from the list.
- Use `/summary` for an overview of the project: tickets, assignments, and who's responsible.
