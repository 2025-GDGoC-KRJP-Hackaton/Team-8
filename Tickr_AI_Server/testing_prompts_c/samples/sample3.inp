[17-May-25 10:05 AM] Leo#7771 love the vibe â€” clean UI, zero fluff. "FreelanceFlow"?
[17-May-25 10:05 AM] Nia#3142 or "MintDesk"? idk I like both
[17-May-25 10:06 AM] Tom#6640 "MintDesk" sounds slick af

[17-May-25 10:07 AM] Leo#7771 alright, MintDesk it is. Iâ€™ll start the frontend â€” thinking SvelteKit?
[17-May-25 10:07 AM] Tom#6640 Iâ€™ll handle backend with Supabase, quick to get user auth + database up
[17-May-25 10:08 AM] Nia#3142 Iâ€™ll mock up the UI and UX flow, and research what freelancers actually need

[17-May-25 10:09 AM] Leo#7771 letâ€™s meet again Friday to review MVP features
[17-May-25 10:09 AM] Nia#3142 Iâ€™ll make a shared Notion for docs + roadmap
